          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Story</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            Founded in 2022 by game designer and developer Dejan Noveski, Deno
            Games was born from a passion for creating engaging, accessible
            tabletop games that anyone can enjoy. What started as a hobby
            designing games for friends and family has grown into a boutique
            print-and-play game studio with a dedicated community of players
            around the world.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
            At Deno Games, we believe that great gaming experiences should be
            accessible to everyone. Our mission is to create high-quality
            print-and-play board games that bring people together, spark
            imagination, and provide hours of entertainment without breaking the
            bank. We're committed to designing games that are easy to learn,
            challenging to master, and most importantly, fun to play again and
            again.
